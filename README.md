# Note-Taker

* Using the given files, application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. We build the back end, connect the two files, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

* We start by installing express, and then using GET API routes requests and to communicate from client to server and then we used POST API request to get it from server to client.
